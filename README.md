# Recommendation System 1: Content-Based Model

Description:
This model leverages content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their features and user preferences.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
	- Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset for movie metadata.
	- Extracts movie features such as genres and tags for content-based recommendations.
	- Constructs TF-IDF vectors or embeddings for movies based on their textual features.
	- Computes similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity or other metrics.
	- Recommends movies to users based on their historical preferences and movie similarities.

# Recommendation System 2: NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering) Model

Description:
This model uses a neural network approach to learn user-item interactions and make recommendations.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
	- Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset for user-movie ratings.
	- Creates embedding layers for users and movies to learn their latent representations.
	- Defines a neural network architecture (typically MLP or similar) to predict user ratings.
	- Trains the model using techniques like negative sampling to improve recommendations.
	- Evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE or precision-recall.

# Recommendation System 3: Data Exploration and Visualization Model

Description:
This script focuses on exploring and visualizing the MovieLens dataset to gain insights into movie ratings and genres.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
	- Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset to analyze movie ratings and genres.
	- Uses Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.
	- Visualizes the distribution of movie ratings and genres across the dataset.
	- Computes statistics such as average ratings per movie and user engagement.
	- Provides interactive plots and insights into movie preferences and trends.
