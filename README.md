# Recommendation System 1: Content-Based Model

Description:
This model leverages content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their features and user preferences.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
<br>
1.Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset for movie metadata.
<br>
2.Extracts movie features such as genres and tags for content-based recommendations.
<br>
3.Constructs TF-IDF vectors or embeddings for movies based on their textual features.
<br>
4.Computes similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity or other metrics.
<br>
5.Recommends movies to users based on their historical preferences and movie similarities.
<br>

# Recommendation System 2: NCF (Neural Collaborative Filtering) Model

Description:
This model uses a neural network approach to learn user-item interactions and make recommendations.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
<br>
1.Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset for user-movie ratings.
<br>
2.Creates embedding layers for users and movies to learn their latent representations.
<br>
3.Defines a neural network architecture (typically MLP or similar) to predict user ratings.
<br>
4.Trains the model using techniques like negative sampling to improve recommendations.
<br>
5.Evaluates model performance using metrics like RMSE or precision-recall.
<br>

# Recommendation System 3: Data Exploration and Visualization Model

Description:
This script focuses on exploring and visualizing the MovieLens dataset to gain insights into movie ratings and genres.

Dataset:
MovieLens 100k dataset.

Features:
<br>
1.Loads and preprocesses MovieLens 100k dataset to analyze movie ratings and genres.
<br>
2.Uses Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data exploration and visualization.
<br>
3.Visualizes the distribution of movie ratings and genres across the dataset.
<br>
4.Computes statistics such as average ratings per movie and user engagement.
<br>
5.Provides interactive plots and insights into movie preferences and trends.
